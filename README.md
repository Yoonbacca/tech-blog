# Tech Blog

## Description
![Tech Blog](./Assets/screenshot.png)

This is a full stack project written and developed by Yoon-Jae Kim. Parts of the code here were lifted from the Mini-Project of Module 14 of the NW Coding Bootcamp.

The purpose of this was project is to solidfy the MVC model concept by having us create a fully functional website from scratch. The website is a simple tech blog that allows users to login, sign up, post blogposts, and comment on said blogposts. 

The Models for this project boil down to three separate tables, Users, Posts, and Comments. The Views are handled by Handlebar and pull Models via the Controller, handled by Express.
